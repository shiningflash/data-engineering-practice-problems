## Problem 4: Schema Evolution & Validation for Streaming Events (Avro-style Thinking)

**Scenario:**
You’re building a streaming pipeline that ingests **user event data** from multiple microservices.
The data comes in JSON format like this:

```json
{"user_id": 101, "event_type": "login", "timestamp": "2025-10-14T12:00:00Z"}
{"user_id": 102, "event_type": "purchase", "amount": 59.99, "timestamp": "2025-10-14T12:02:15Z"}
{"user_id": "103", "event_type": "logout", "timestamp": "2025-10-14T12:05:20Z"}
{"event_type": "login", "timestamp": "2025-10-14T12:07:00Z"}
```

But because these events come from **different teams and versions**, they are often **incomplete, inconsistent, or evolve over time**:

* `user_id` might be a string or int
* `amount` may appear only for purchase events
* Some fields may be missing
* Future versions may include new fields (like `device` or `location`)

Your goal: **Validate and normalize** these events before they are published to your downstream system (e.g., BigQuery, Kafka, or Pub/Sub).

---

### Task:

Write a Python program that:

1. Reads a JSON lines file (`events.jsonl`) line by line (treat it as streaming input).
2. Validates and normalizes each event based on this **expected schema**:

| Field      | Type  | Required | Notes                                                            |
| ---------- | ----- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| user_id    | int   | ✅ Yes    | Convert to int if possible; skip event if missing or invalid     |
| event_type | str   | ✅ Yes    | Must be one of `"login"`, `"logout"`, `"purchase"`               |
| timestamp  | str   | ✅ Yes    | Must be valid ISO8601                                            |
| amount     | float | ❌ No     | Only required for `"purchase"` events; default to 0.0 if missing |
| device     | str   | ❌ No     | Optional new field (can be present or not)                       |

3. Writes **valid normalized events** to `cleaned_events.jsonl`.
4. Writes **invalid events** to `invalid_events.jsonl` with an extra field `"error_reason"` describing why it failed validation.

---

### Example Output (cleaned_events.jsonl):

```json
{"user_id": 101, "event_type": "login", "timestamp": "2025-10-14T12:00:00Z", "amount": 0.0}
{"user_id": 102, "event_type": "purchase", "timestamp": "2025-10-14T12:02:15Z", "amount": 59.99}
{"user_id": 103, "event_type": "logout", "timestamp": "2025-10-14T12:05:20Z", "amount": 0.0}
```

### Example Output (invalid_events.jsonl):

```json
{"event_type": "login", "timestamp": "2025-10-14T12:07:00Z", "error_reason": "missing user_id"}
{"user_id": "abc", "event_type": "purchase", "timestamp": "2025-10-14T12:09:00Z", "amount": "NaN", "error_reason": "user_id not convertible to int"}
```

### Bonus Challenges (Highly Recommended):

* Make your schema **evolution-proof** – gracefully ignore unknown fields instead of failing.
* Keep counters: total events processed, valid, invalid.
* Use `pydantic` (optional but very powerful) for validation.

---

💡 **Hints:**

* Use `json.loads()` for streaming line-by-line.
* Use `try/except` for type conversions.
* Keep validation and normalization logic inside a single clean function.
* Think about how you’d handle new fields without code changes — this is key for schema evolution.
